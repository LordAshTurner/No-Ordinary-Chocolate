# This is no Ordinary Chocolate 
## Chocolate is one of the most popular candies in the world. Each year, residents of the United States collectively eat more than 2.8 billion pounds. However, not all chocolate bars are created equal! This dataset contains expert ratings of over 1,700 individual chocolate bars, regional origin, percentage of cocoa, the type of chocolate bean used and where the beans were grown. 
# Each chocolate is evaluated from a combination of both objective qualities and subjective interpretation. A rating here only represents an experience with one bar from one batch. There are 4 factors when evaluating the rating of each bar. 
***Note: This dataset was already compiled by Brady Brelinski, Founding Member of the Manhattan Chocolate Society.  For any additional information, please see his website: Flavors of Cacao.***

## Flavor- is the most important component of the Flavors of Cacao ratings. Diversity, balance, intensity, and purity of flavors are all considered. A chocolate bar with 5 ingredients can be more savory on the tongue than a bar with a list full of complex ingredients. Genetics, post-harvesting techniques, the melting point, processing and storage should be considered when discussing the flavor component.

## Texture- has a great impact on the overall experience, and it may impact flavor. It is a good way to evaluate the makers vision, attention to detail and level of proficiency.

## Aftermelt- is the experience after the chocolate has melted on the tongue or fingers. Higher quality chocolate will linger and have a long-lasting and enjoyable experience. Since the aftermelt is the last impression you get from the chocolate, it receives equal importance in the overall rating.

## Overall- a personal opinion is really where the ratings reflect a subjective opinion. The evaluation consists of whether the components above worked together and an opinion on the flavor development, character and style. 

## Key Questions
+ What are the ratings based on the cocoa beans?
+ What countries provide the highest rated cocoa beans?
+ What are the top 10-15 companies?

## Hypothesis: If the countries closer to the equator produce better cocoa beans (including the cacao percentage), then those countries would produce high chocolate ratings. 

## 1 Dataset (Flavors_of_cacao) **For Python I filtered, cleaned/removed duplicates, data wrangling, aggregation and grouping subset data to look at the patterns and facts within the chocolate dataset.**
